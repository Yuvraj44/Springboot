"/auth/**" -> permitted

"/" -> GET-> View all users

".auth/register" -> POST -> to register

"/auth/authorization" -> POST -> to authorize



When we register, we get a token.

When we authorize, we match the user and password.

When any HTTP request(unpermitted) is made, a token is required, and the HTTP request passes through a filter which:
1. Check if jwt exists.
2. Check if user mapped to jwt exists in DB using UserDetailService
3. Update Security Context Holder
